# NBA 2K25 Player Progression System

## About

The website can be found at [nba2kpt.com](https://www.nba2kpt.com).

This project is inspired by [u/rustyhwe's](https://www.reddit.com/user/rustyhwe/) [Player Lock Progression System](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/xl11pq/player_lock_progression_system/) for playing MyNBA as a single player in NBA 2K23. Unlike the traditional MyCareer mode, this system allows for more organic player growth without spending hours grinding off the court and walking everywhere.

As part of my Python programming journey, I decided to take [u/rustyhwe's](https://www.reddit.com/user/rustyhwe/) logic and build it into a web-based tracker using Python and Flask. This version, **NBA 2K25 Player Progression Tracker**, includes extended features, a better user interface, and more customization options.

## Core Idea

The progression system ties player upgrades to in-game performance. The better you perform, the more points you earn to upgrade attributes and badges. This approach makes player development more immersive and engaging.

## Features

The tracker provides a simple interface to manage all progression activities across a few screens:

- **Dashboard**: Create new players, input game statistics, or upgrade attributes and badges.
- **Create a New Player**: Add new players to track their progression.
- **Input Game Statistics**: Enter stats after each game to generate development and badge points.
- **Upgrade Attributes and Badges**: Spend earned points to improve your player’s attributes and badges.
- **Profile Administration**: Update your password, delete your account, or customize the points-earning system.

## Getting Started

Everything you need to track and manage your player's progression is available on this web application. The program is designed to be intuitive, so you can focus on enjoying the game while managing progression seamlessly.

## Feedback and Contributions

Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly appreciated! Feel free to try out the system and propose improvements or enhancements. Let’s make this tool even better together.
